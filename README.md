# Advent of Code 2023

[Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/)

This repo does **not** contain input files, nor does it provide output answers.  It is merely the code I used to get the answers.  Though to be fair, they should all work, more or less.

To run this repo, you must create the following folder structure in the solition:

``` txt
[Root]  
    + InputFiles  
    |---+ ProblemData  
    |---|---- day1.txt  
    |---|---- day2.txt  
    |---|---- day3.txt  
    |---|---- (etc)  
    |---+ SampleData  
    |---|---- day1.txt  
    |---|---- day2.txt  
    |---|---- day3.txt  
    |---|---- (etc)  
```
